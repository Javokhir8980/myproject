              A team is a group of individuals (human or non-human) working together to achieve their goal.
              <span>   As defined by Professor Leigh Thompson of the Kellogg School of Management, "[a] team is a group of people who are <br>           
                interdependent with respect to information, resources, knowledge and skills and who seek to combine their efforts to achieve a
                 common goal".A group does not necessarily constitute a team. Teams normally have members with complementary skills <br>
                  and generate synergy <br>
                   through a coordinated effort which allows each member to maximize their strengths and minimize their weaknesses. Naresh <br>
                    Jain (2009) claims: </span>
                    <span">Team members need to learn how to help one another, help other team members realize their true potential, and create an <br> environment that allows everyone to go beyond their limitations.</span> 
                    <span>
                    While academic research on teams and teamwork has grown consistently and has shown a sharp increase over the past recent 40 years, the societal diffusion of teams and teamwork actually followed a volatile trend in the 20th century. The concept was introduced into business in the late 20th century, which was followed by a popularization of the concept of constructing teams. Differing opinions exist on the efficacy of this new management fad. <br> Some see "team" as a four-letter word: overused and under-useful.
                    <br> Others see it as a panacea that realizes the human-relations movement's desire to integrate what that movement perceives as best for workers and as best for managers. <br> Still others believe in the effectiveness of teams, but also see them as dangerous because of the potential for exploiting <br>
                     workers â€” in that team effectiveness can rely on peer pressure and peer surveillance. <br> However, Hackman sees team effectiveness not only in terms of performance: a truly effective team will contribute to the personal well-being and adaptive growth of its members.English-speakers commonly use the word "team" in today's society to characterise many types of groups. Peter Guy Northouse's book Leadership: theory and practice <br> discusses teams from a leadership perspective. According to the team approach to leadership, a team is a type of <br> organizational group of people that are members. A team is composed of members who are dependent on each other, work towards interchangeable achievements, and share common attainments. A team works as a whole together to achieve certain things. A team is usually located in the same setting as it is normally connected to a kind of organization, company, or community. Teams can meet in-person (directly face-to-face) or virtually when practicing their values and activities or duties.A team's com
